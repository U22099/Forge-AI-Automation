üöÄ **AI-Powered Lead Generation & Analysis Automation**

[![Readme was generated by Dokugen](https://img.shields.io/badge/Readme%20was%20generated%20by-Dokugen-brightgreen)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dokugen)

This project provides a robust, AI-driven solution for automating lead generation and analysis. It processes raw lead data from Excel, leverages Google Gemini AI to analyze company information and score lead quality, and then compiles and emails a comprehensive report. Additionally, it features a lightweight Express.js web server for basic service exposure.

## Overview
This TypeScript-based application combines an Express.js server with automated data processing workflows. It utilizes the Google Gemini API for intelligent lead qualification, ExcelJS for spreadsheet manipulation, and Nodemailer for automated report distribution, all managed with robust logging via Pino.

## Features
*   ‚ú® **AI-Powered Lead Qualification**: Utilizes Google Gemini AI to analyze business information and generate a concise summary along with a lead quality score.
*   üìä **Automated Data Processing**: Reads raw lead data from Excel or JSON, processes it, and writes enriched data to a new Excel file.
*   üìß **Automated Email Reporting**: Automatically compiles processed lead data into an HTML email body and sends it with an attached Excel report to a specified recipient.
*   üåê **Lightweight Web Interface**: Includes a basic Express.js server serving an EJS view and a simple API endpoint for health checks or basic interaction.
*   ü™µ **Comprehensive Logging**: Implements Pino for structured and human-readable logging across all processing stages.

## Getting Started
### Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  ‚¨áÔ∏è **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/u22099/Forge-AI-Automation
    cd Forge-AI-Automation
    ```
2.  üì¶ **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  ‚öôÔ∏è **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the following required environment variables:

| Variable             | Description                                          | Example                                |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `RAW_DATA_FILE`      | Path to the input Excel file containing raw leads.   | `raw_leads.xlsx`                       |
| `PROCESSED_DATA_FILE`| Path for the output Excel file with processed leads. | `processed_leads.xlsx`                 |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`     | Your Google Gemini API key.                          | `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`             |
| `SENDER_EMAIL`       | The email address used to send reports.              | `your_sending_email@gmail.com`         |
| `SENDER_PASSWORD`    | The app password for the `SENDER_EMAIL` (for Gmail, generate an App Password). | `your_email_app_password`              |
| `RECEIVER_EMAIL`     | The email address to receive the reports. (Note: Currently hardcoded in `sendEmail.ts` for demonstration purposes, but can be managed via environment variable for production.) | `recipient_email@example.com`          |
| `PINO_LOG_LEVEL`     | Optional: Sets the logging level (e.g., `info`, `debug`, `warn`, `error`). | `info`                                 |
| `PORT`               | Optional: Port for the Express.js web server.        | `8080`                                 |

**Example `.env` file**:
```dotenv
RAW_DATA_FILE=raw_leads.xlsx
PROCESSED_DATA_FILE=processed_leads.xlsx
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY
SENDER_EMAIL=your_sending_email@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password
RECEIVER_EMAIL=recipient_email@example.com
PORT=8080
PINO_LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Usage
This project offers two primary modes of operation: a web server and an automated lead processing and email reporting script.

### Running the Web Server
To start the Express.js web server, which serves a basic homepage and a simple API endpoint:

```bash
npm start
```
The server will typically start on `http://localhost:8080` (or the `PORT` specified in your `.env` file). You can then access the homepage and the `/api` endpoint through your web browser or API client.

### Running the Lead Processing Automation
The core automation workflow involves processing leads with AI and sending out email reports. This can be run as a combined command:

```bash
npm run start-automation
```
This command will:
1.  **Build the project**: Compile TypeScript files to JavaScript and copy necessary assets.
2.  **Process Leads**: Execute the `processLeads.js` script, which reads data from `RAW_DATA_FILE`, analyzes it using the configured AI model, and writes the results to `PROCESSED_DATA_FILE`.
3.  **Send Email**: Execute the `sendEmail.js` script, which reads the processed data from `PROCESSED_DATA_FILE`, formats it into an HTML email, attaches the Excel report, and sends it to the `RECEIVER_EMAIL`.

You can also run the processing and emailing steps individually:
*   To only process leads:
    ```bash
    npm run processLeads
    ```
*   To only send the email (assuming `PROCESSED_DATA_FILE` already exists):
    ```bash
    npm run sendEmail
    ```

## API Documentation
